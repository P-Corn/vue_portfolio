ISSUES
-----

-Needed to change the background color of the contact section. Couldn't color the entire
section because of the margin. Changed it to padding and it works... But it doesn't use the 
awesome overlapping effect like margin does. It's less consistent.

-----
TODOS
-----

-Contact form was changed so the forms functionality might need to be adjusted.

-------------------------

-----
NOTES
-----
-Organize CSS like you're looking at the thing you are styling, from top to bottom.

-Make sure to use the font size variables for font sizes and not the general sizing variables.
I did this..
